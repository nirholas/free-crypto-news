/**
 * Model names, in one place.
 *
 * `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` was hardcoded in a dozen modules. Groq retired it
 * for our account and every AI-backed endpoint started answering 500:
 * /api/signals, /api/sentiment, /api/summarize, article enrichment, the
 * translator, the oracle. Nothing pointed at the outage because each call site
 * carried its own copy of the string.
 *
 * A model name is deployment configuration, not a constant. Everything here
 * reads an environment variable first and falls back to a model we have
 * verified against the live account, so the next retirement is one env var
 * away from fixed instead of a dozen edits.
 *
 * This module deliberately has no imports: every AI client can depend on it
 * without risking an import cycle.
 *
 * @module lib/ai-models
