## 💻 Development Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines

3. **Test your changes** locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new endpoint for market data"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve caching issue in /api/news"
   ```

   We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation
   - `style:` - Code style (formatting, etc.)
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

5. **Verify changelog coverage**:
   ```bash
   # Check if your changes are documented
   node scripts/analyze-commits.js --check --since=HEAD~5
   ```

6. **Push to your fork** and open a PR

### Test Coverage Ratchet

This project uses a coverage ratchet — test coverage thresholds automatically increase
as you add tests and can never decrease. If your PR reduces coverage, the quality gate
will fail.

- Check current thresholds: see `vitest.config.ts` → `coverage.thresholds`
- After adding tests: run `bun run coverage:ratchet` to update thresholds
- The pre-push hook automatically verifies coverage hasn't dropped via the quality gate

### Database Changes

If your PR modifies `src/lib/db/schema.ts`:

1. Run `bun run db:generate` to create a migration file
2. Review the generated SQL in `src/lib/db/migrations/`
3. Include the migration file in your PR
4. Test the migration locally with `bun run db:migrate`
5. Note any data migration needs in the PR description

See [docs/DATABASE-MIGRATIONS.md](docs/DATABASE-MIGRATIONS.md) for the full workflow.

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you're changing functionality
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** for significant changes:
   ```bash
   # See what entries might be missing
   node scripts/analyze-commits.js
   
   # Auto-add missing entries (review before committing)
   node scripts/analyze-commits.js --update
   ```
3. **Add tests** for new features if applicable
4. **Ensure CI passes** - the build must succeed
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** promptly and constructively

### PR Title Format
