## Method 1: MCP Server for Claude Desktop (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nirholas/cryptocurrency.cv.git
cd cryptocurrency.cv/mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

Find your Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/free-crypto-news/mcp/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (macOS):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/free-crypto-news/mcp/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

In Claude Desktop, you should see "crypto-news" in the available tools. Ask:

## Method 3: Direct API with Claude API

Use Claude's API to build automated crypto news systems.

### Python Example

```python
import anthropic
import requests

# Initialize Claude client
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Fetch crypto news
def get_crypto_news(limit=10):
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/news?limit={limit}"
    )
    return response.json()

# Analyze news with Claude
def analyze_with_claude(news_data):
    articles_text = "\n\n".join([
        f"**{a['title']}**\n{a['description']}\nSource: {a['source']}"
        for a in news_data.get('articles', [])[:10]
    ])
    
    message = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""Analyze these crypto news articles and provide:
1. Overall market sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
2. Key themes and trends
3. Potential market impact
4. Risk factors to watch

Articles:
{articles_text}"""
            }
        ]
    )
    return message.content[0].text

# Main workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Fetching crypto news...")
    news = get_crypto_news(10)
    
    print("Analyzing with Claude...")
    analysis = analyze_with_claude(news)
    
    print("\n📊 CRYPTO NEWS ANALYSIS")
    print("=" * 50)
    print(analysis)
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });

async function getCryptoNews(limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/news?limit=${limit}`
  );
  return response.json();
}

async function analyzeWithClaude(newsData) {
  const articlesText = newsData.articles
    .slice(0, 10)
    .map(a => `**${a.title}**\n${a.description}\nSource: ${a.source}`)
    .join('\n\n');

  const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
    max_tokens: 1024,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Analyze these crypto news articles and provide:
1. Overall market sentiment
2. Key themes and trends
3. Potential market impact
4. Risk factors

Articles:
${articlesText}`
      }
    ]
  });

  return message.content[0].text;
}

// Run analysis
const news = await getCryptoNews(10);
const analysis = await analyzeWithClaude(news);
console.log(analysis);
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Appearing

1. Check the config file path is correct
2. Verify the full path to `index.js`
3. Ensure Node.js is installed and in PATH
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

**View logs (macOS):**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

### Tools Not Working

1. Test the API directly:
```bash
curl https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/news?limit=5
```

2. Check if MCP server starts correctly:
```bash
cd /path/to/free-crypto-news/mcp
node index.js
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### Rate Limiting

The API has generous rate limits, but if you hit them:
1. Reduce the frequency of requests
2. Use caching for repeated queries
3. Consider self-hosting for heavy usage
