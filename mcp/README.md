# Free Crypto News MCP server

Give Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT or any other [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client live crypto news, prices, DeFi, derivatives and on-chain data from [cryptocurrency.cv](https://cryptocurrency.cv).

No API key. No account. No signup.

---

## Install

### Option 1: hosted (nothing to install)

The server runs on our infrastructure at `https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/mcp` over Streamable HTTP. Fastest path, and it stays up to date on its own.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http crypto-news https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf** (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, and friends)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "url": "https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: local (stdio)

Runs on your machine and talks to the same public API. Useful behind a proxy, or when you want to point it at your own deployment.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nirholas/free-crypto-news-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirholas/cryptocurrency.cv.git
cd cryptocurrency.cv/mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/cryptocurrency.cv/mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your client after editing its config, then ask it something like *"what is the latest Bitcoin ETF news?"* or *"compare SOL and ETH over the last 30 days"*.

## Configuration

Every setting is optional.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_BASE` | `https://cryptocurrency.cv` | Point the server at another deployment, for example `http://localhost:3000` |
| `API_KEY` | none | Sent as `x-api-key`. Raises rate limits and unlocks paid endpoints |
| `API_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-news": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nirholas/free-crypto-news-mcp"],
      "env": { "API_KEY": "your-key" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Transports

| Transport | Command | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stdio | `npm start` | Local MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) |
| Streamable HTTP | `npm run start:http` | Self-hosting the HTTP endpoint yourself (`PORT`, default 8787) |

The hosted endpoint at `https://cryptocurrency.cv/api/mcp` serves this same tool registry from the main Next.js app (`src/app/api/mcp/route.ts`), stateless, one server instance per request.

---

## Paid endpoints

Most tools are free and unauthenticated. A few sit behind the [x402](https://cryptocurrency.cv/x402) micropayment gate; those tools return a readable `Payment required` message naming the endpoint and its price rather than a raw HTTP error, so the model can explain the situation instead of retrying blindly. Set `API_KEY` to use them.

---

## Tools

<!-- TOOLS:START -->

**55 tools.** Every tool maps onto one real REST route of the API.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # tsc -> dist/
npm run dev          # stdio server via tsx, no build step
npm run dev:http     # HTTP server via tsx
npm run typecheck
npm test             # offline: protocol handshake + registry invariants
npm run test:live    # additionally calls one tool against production
npm run docs:tools   # regenerate the tool table above from the registry
```

Source layout:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/api.ts` | HTTP client: URL building, timeouts, x402 handling, error shaping |
| `src/tools.ts` | The tool registry. One entry per tool, each naming its REST route |
| `src/resources.ts` | MCP resources |
| `src/prompts.ts` | MCP prompts |
| `src/server.ts` | Wires the registry into an MCP `Server` |
| `src/index.ts` | stdio entry point |
| `src/http.ts` | Streamable HTTP entry point |

Adding a tool means adding one entry to `src/tools.ts` with its `endpoint`, then running `npm run docs:tools`. The smoke test enforces that every tool has a unique snake_case name, a real description, and a route under `/api/`.
